# Section 1: Introduction and Getting Started

## Overview
In this section, we explore JavaScript runtimes like NodeJS and create our own custom runtime using Rust. We'll start by covering key concepts related to JavaScript engines and runtimes, followed by setting up Rust and initializing a basic project.

## Steps
1. **Install Rust**: Follow the official guide to install Rust and Cargo, the package manager.
2. **Initialize Project**: Run `cargo init` to create a new Rust project named "MyJS".
3. **Set Up Dependencies**: Modify the `Cargo.toml` file to add necessary dependencies.
4. **Create JS Runtime**: Write a Rust function to execute JavaScript code using Deno's core bindings.
5. **Test the Runtime**: Create a simple JS file and run it through the custom runtime using `cargo run`.
